<h1> Oh My POSH Themes </h1>

I'd like to first give a special thanks to Jan DeDObbleer for creating these themes and the oh-my-posh theme engine. With that being said, the process of using a theme is easy. There, however, are some prerequisites.

<h3> PREREQUISITES</h3>

<ol>
   <li> You must have <a href="https://ohmyposh.dev/"> oh-my-posh </a> installed. </li>
   <li> Have a <a href="https://www.nerdfonts.com/"> Nerd Font </a> installed </li>
   <li> Have a user profile at <code>$PROFILE</code> and <code> $HOME\.config\powershell\user_profile.ps1 </code> set up. </li>
   <li> Have your ExecutionPolicy set to 'ReomteSigned' </li>
</ol>

Once all of these steps are fulfilled you can move on to the next steps.

<h3> Setting up the theme </h3>
To set up the theme Follow these steps. <b>
<ol> 
   <li> Have this repo cloned. </li>
   <li> copy the file location of the desired theme on your computer to your clipboard. </li>
   <li> look for the <code> --config </code> flag in the <code> user_profile.ps1 </code> file and replace the location I have listed there with the location of the theme on your machine. </li>
   <li> Restart your powershell or open another instance of it on windows terminal. </li>
</ol>

After restarting your Powershell or relaunching it on windows terminal you should see the correct appearance of your theme.
